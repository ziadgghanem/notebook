### Construction of a Measure

The goal is to define the map $\mu: \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ on some reasonable collection
of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n,$ $ \mathcal{S}$ satisfying the following four properties of measure
1. *Positivity:* $\mu > 0$
2. *$\sigma$- additivity:*
3. *Normalization:* $\mu(I^n) = 1$ where $I = [0,1]$
4. *Congruency:* If $A$ is obtained from $B$ by translation or orthogonal transformation 
(i.e. if $A,B\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ are congruent) then $\mu(A) = \mu(B)$

Such a map is called a measure and its construction will be the focus of this section.

A reasonable question to ask: can a map satisfying these properties
be defined on $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^n),$ the set of all subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$?

<div class="proposition" markdown="1">

**Proposition**

There is no map $\mu: \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^n) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfying the properties of measure.

<div class="proof" markdown="1">


Assume for simplicity that $n=1,$ suppose, for contradiction, that $\mu: \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a map
satisfying the listed properties.

Consider the family of subsets $\lbrace N_r \rbrace^{\infty}_{r=1}$ constructed such that
1. $ \bigcup_{r} N_r = [0,1)$ 
2. $ N_r \cap N_s = \emptyset$ for all $r \neq s$
3. $\mu(N_r) = \mu(N_s)$ for all $r,s$

As $\lbrace N_r \rbrace^{\infty}_{r=1}$ are disjoint and $\mu$ is $\sigma$- additive
- $\mu[0,1) = \sum^{\infty}_{r=1} \mu(N_r)$ 

And by normalization 
- $\sum^{\infty}_{r=1} \mu(N_r) = 1$ 

Now consider two cases that both lead to contradiction
1. *Case:* assume that $\forall r$ $\mu(N_r) = 0$
    - But then, $1 = 0 + 0 + \cdots = 0$ $\rightarrow$ contradiction.
2. *Case:* assume that $\forall r$ $\mu(N_r) = \alpha > 0$
    - But then, $1 = \alpha + \alpha + \cdots = \infty$ $\rightarrow$ contradiction.

What remains is to show that such a family of sets $\lbrace N_r \rbrace^{\infty}_{r=1}$ indeed exists.

### Rectangular Measure

<div class="definition" markdown="1">

**Measure on Rectangles**

Let $X$ be any one of the following sets 
- $[a,b],[a,b),(a,b],(a,b)$  

And $Y$ any one of 
- $[c,d],[c,d),(c,d],(c,d)$ 

Then the set $P = X \times Y$ is called a **rectangle**.

In the degenerate case that either $a=b$ or $c=d$ then we say that the rectangle is *empty* and write $P = \emptyset$ 

We define the measure of a rectangle $P$ as follows:
- $\mu(P) = \begin{cases}(b-a)(d-c), \quad \text{if} \; \text{P} \neq \emptyset \\ 0, \quad \text{if} \; \text{P} = \emptyset \end{cases}$

</div>


<details>
<summary><i style="font-size:150%;">Proof</i></summary>

<div class="proof" markdown="1">

It is clear that such a measure on the set of planar rectangles is well-defined and satisfies the four properties of measure
namely:
1. *Positivity:* $\mu \geq 0$ as $b>a$ and $d>c$
2. *$\sigma$- additivity:* If $\lbrace P_n \rbrace^{k}_{n=1}$ is a finite collection of disjoint rectangles we have
    - $ \mu(\bigcup^k_{n=1} P_n) = \sum^{k}_{n=1} \mu(P_n)$ 
3. *Normalization:* By inspection, $\mu([0,1] \times [0,1]) = 1 $
4. *Congruence*

</div>
</details>


So, we have a valid measure theory on the set of planar rectangles.
Our proximate goal is to extend this theory to as wide a collection of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ as possible, while preserving
the properties of measure. The next step is to consider how our measure acts on sets built from finitely many disjoint rectangles.

<div class="definition" markdown="1">

**Elementary Sets**

A set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is called *elementary* if it can be represented as a finite union of disjoint rectangles.
</div>


<div class="proposition" markdown="1">

**Proposition**

Suppose that $A,B$ are elementary sets, then so are
1. $A \cap B$ 
2. $A \cup B$ 
3. $A \setminus B$ 
4. $A \Delta B = (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)$ 

where $A \Delta B$ is called the symmetric difference of $A$ and $B$
</div>

<details>
<summary><i style="font-size:150%;">Proof</i></summary>

<div class="proof" markdown="1">


First, we make an observation: if $P,Q$ are rectangles then $P \cap Q$ is also a rectangle and $P \setminus Q$
is elementary.

Now assume $A,B$ are elementary with representations $A = \bigcup^n_{i=1} P_i$ and $B = \bigcup^k_{j=1} Q_j$ for rectangles $P_i,Q_j$

$(1)$ First we consider their intersection: $A \cap B$
- $A \cap B$ $=$ $ (\bigcup^n_{i=1} P_i) \bigcap (\bigcup^k_{j=1} Q_j)$ $=$ $\bigcup_{i,j} (P_i \cap Q_j)$ 

where $P_i \cap Q_j$ are rectangles by observation such that $A \cap B$ is indeed elementary.

<hr>

**Corollary:** Let $P$ be a rectangle and $A \subset P$ an elementary set. Then, $P \setminus A$ is also elementary.

*Proof:* 

Express our elementary set as a finite disjoint union of rectangles $A = \bigcup^n_{i=1} P_i$ Now,
- $P \setminus A = P \setminus \bigcup^n_{i=1} P_i = \bigcap^n_{i=1} (P \ P_i)$
- By initial observation, each $(P \ P_i)$ is elementary 
- And so, by result $(1)$ $P \setminus A$ is elementary

<hr>

$(2)$ Next we consider their union: $A \cup B$
- Take a rectangle $P$ containing both $A$ and $B$
- So, $A \cup B = P \setminus [(P \setminus A) \cap (P \setminus B)]$ 
- $(P \setminus A)$ and $(P \setminus B)$ are elementary by collary
- In turn, $A \cup B$ is elementary by corollary

<hr>

$(3)$ Consider their difference: $A \setminus B$
- Again, take a rectangle $P$ containing both $A$ and $B$
- Now, $A \setminus B = A \cap (P \setminus B)$ 
- $(P \setminus B)$ and $A \cap (P \setminus B)$ are elementary by collary and $(1)$ respectively.

<hr>

$(4)$ Finally consider their symmetric difference: $A \Delta B$
- Write $A \Delta B = (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)$
- $A \Delta B$ is elementary by $(1),(2),(3)$

</div>
</details>


We are now equpped to extend our measure theory to include elementary sets. For simplicity, we will initially
only consider subsets of the unit square $E = [0,1] \times [0,1]$ and then show how this assumption is easily discarded.

### Elementary Measure

<div class="definition" markdown="1">

**Measure on Elementary Sets**

Let $E =  = [0,1] \times [0,1]$ and take elementary set $A \subset E$ which has expression as finite union of disjoint rectangles, $A = \bigcup^n_{i=1} P_i$, where $P_i \cap P_j = \emptyset \; \forall_{i \neq j}$

We define the measure of $A$ as
- $ \mu(A):= \sum^n_{i=1} \mu(P_i)$

</div>

Every elementary set must have expression as the finite union of disjoint rectangles, however, this expression need not be unique.
There is a reasonable concern that distinct rectangular partitions of $A$ might have different measures. We will prove that this is not 
the case.

<div class="proposition" markdown="1">

**Proposition**

The measure of an elementary set is independent of its partition.

</div>

<details>
<summary><i style="font-size:150%;">Proof</i></summary>

<div class="proof" markdown="1">


Given elementary $A$ take any two rectangular partitions of $A$
- $\bigcup^n_{i=1} P_i,$ $\bigcup^m_{j=1} Q_j$ 

$P_i \cap P_j = \emptyset \; \forall_{i \neq j}$ and $Q_l \cap Q_k = \emptyset \; \forall_{l \neq k}$. 

We make the observation that
1.  $ \sum^n_{i=1} \mu(P_i) = \sum^n_{i=1} \sum^m_{j=1} \mu(P_i \cap Q_j)$ 
2.  $ \sum^m_{j=1} \mu(Q_j) = \sum^m_{j=1} \sum^n_{i=1} \mu(Q_j \cap P_i)$ 

Hence $\mu(A):= \sum^n_{i=1} \mu(P_i) = \sum^m_{j=1} \mu(Q_j)$

</div>
</details>


A measure must satisfy the properties of a measure, lets check that $\mu$ is $\sigma$-additive on elementary sets

<div class="proposition" markdown="1">

**Proposition**

The measure of an elementary set is $\sigma$-semi-additive i.e.

Suppose $A, \lbrace A_n \rbrace_{n=1}^{\infty} \subset E$ are elementary sets with $A \subset \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$ then,
- $\mu(A) \leq \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \mu(A_n)$
</div>

<div class="proof" markdown="1">

Fix some $\epsilon > 0$

**Step 1:** Approximation of $A$ by compact subset

<hr>

As an elementary set, $A$ may be expressed as the finite union of disjoint rectangles
- $A = \bigcup_{i=1}^{k} B_i$ where $ \lbrace B_i \rbrace$ is the disjoint family of rectangles

For each $B_i$ find a closed rectangle $\hat{B}_i$ such that
1. $\hat{B}_i$ \subset B_i$ 
2. $\mu(B_i) \leq \mu(\hat{B}_i) + \frac{\epsilon}{2k}$ 

Put $\hat{A}:= \bigcup_{i=1}^{k} \hat{B}_i,$ then 
1. $\hat{A}$ is an compact 
2. $\hat{A} \subset A$ 
3. $\mu(A) \leq \sum_{i=1}^{k} [\mu(\hat{B}_i) + \frac{\epsilon}{2k}]$
    - $\leq \sum_{i=1}^{k} \mu(\hat{B}_i) + \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{\epsilon}{2k} $ 
    - $ \leq \mu(\hat{A}) + \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ 

**Step 2:** Open approximation of $\lbrace A_n \rbrace$ 

<hr>

For each $A_n$ find an elementary set $\mathring{A}_n$ such that
1. $A_n \subset \mathring{A}_n$
2. $\mathring{A}_n$ is open
3. $\mu(\mathring{A}_n) \leq \mu(A_n) + \frac{\epsilon}{2^{n+1}}$ 
 
**Step 3:** Application of Heine Borel

<hr>

We have both, $\hat{A} \subset A$ and $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \subset \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \mathring{A}_n $, by construction and $A \subset \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$ by assumption such that $\lbrace \mathring{A}_n \rbrace_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is an open cover of $\hat{A}$ i.e.
- $\hat{A} \subset  \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \mathring{A}_n$ 

As $\hat{A}$ is compact there exists a finite open subcover $\lbrace \mathring{A}_{n_1},\mathring{A}_{n_2}, \ldots, \mathring{A}_{n_s} \rbrace$ such that $\hat{A} \subset  \bigcup^{s}_{k=1} \mathring{A}_{n_k}$. As this cover is, in particular, *finite*, we have
- $\mu(\hat{A}) \leq \sum^{s}_{k=1} \mu(\mathring{A}_{n_k})$

Finally, as $\lbrace \mathring{A}_{n_1},\mathring{A}_{n_2}, \ldots, \mathring{A}_{n_s} \rbrace \subset \lbrace \mathring{A}_n \rbrace_{n=1}^{\infty}$ we can bound $\sum_{k=1}^{s} \mu(\mathring{A}_{n_k}) \leq \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \mu(\mathring{A}_{n})$ such that
- $\mu(\hat{A}) \leq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu(\mathring{A}_{n})$

**Step 4:** Final Estimate

<hr>

In **(Step 1)** we obtained 
- $\mu(A) \leq \mu(\hat{A}) + \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ 

In **(Step 3)** we further bound this with 
- $\mu(A) \leq \mu(\hat{A}) + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \leq \sum^{s}_{k=1} \mu(\mathring{A}_{n_k}) + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \leq \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \mu(\mathring{A}_{n})  + \frac{\epsilon}{2}$

Now, using positivity of $\epsilon$ and linearity of addition,
- $\mu(A) \leq \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}{(\mu(\mathring{A}_{n})  + \frac{\epsilon}{2^{n+1}})} + \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ 
- $ = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}{\mu(\mathring{A}_{n})} + \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}{\frac{\epsilon}{2^{n+1}}} + \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ 
- $ = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}{\mu(\mathring{A}_{n})} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}{\mu(\mathring{A}_{n})} + \epsilon$ 

And so, we have $\mu(A) \leq \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}{\mu(\mathring{A}_{n})} + \epsilon$. As $\epsilon>0$ was chosen arbitrarily we conclude that the measure is indeed semi-$\sigma$-additive on elementary sets
- $\mu(A) \leq \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}{\mu(\mathring{A}_{n})}$ 

</div>
</details>


It has been demonstrated that the measure on elementary sets is semi-$\sigma$-additive. We will prove further that the measure is $\sigma$-additive on elementary sets. 

<div class="definition" markdown="1">

**Proposition:** 

The measure of elementary sets is $\sigma$-additive, i.e. if $A$ is an elementary set with $A = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$ where $\lbrace A_n \rbrace_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a disjoint family of elementary sets,then
- $\mu(A) = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \mu(A_{n})$ 

</div>

<details>
<summary><i style="font-size:150%;">Proof</i></summary>

<div class="proof" markdown="1">


We will show two inequalities, 

$(\leq) \quad$ in which we show that 
- $\mu(A) \leq \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \mu(A_{n})$ 

Indeed, as $A = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$, in particular $A \subset \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$, and so by $\sigma$-semi-additivity we have
- $\mu(A) \leq \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \mu(A_{n})$ 

$(\geq) \quad$ in which we show that 
- $\mu(A) \geq \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \mu(A_{n})$ 

Again we start from the assumption that $A = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$, if we truncate this union at some finite number $N \in \mathbb{N}$ it must be the case that $\bigcup_{n=1}^{N} A_n \subset A$ such that
- $\mu(A) \geq \sum^{N}_{n=1} \mu(A_{n})$ 

Now, as $\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}{\sum^{N}_{n=1}{\mu(A_{n})}} = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}{\mu(A_{n})}$ we simply take the limit as $N \rightarrow \infty$ of both sides of this inequality to obtain the desired result
- $\mu(A) \geq \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \mu(A_{n})$ 

</div>
</details>


<div class="definition" markdown="1">

**Outer Measure**

Take $A \subset E$ and denote by $\mathcal{M}$ the set of all collections of the form $\lbrace A_n \rbrace_{n=1}^{\infty}$ such that
1. $\forall_{n} \quad$ $A_n \subset E$
2. $\forall_{n} \quad$ $A_n$ is a rectangle
3. $A \subset \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$ 

The outer measure of $A$ is here defined
- $\mu^{\star}(A):= \inf_{\lbrace A_n \rbrace \in \mathcal{M}} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{\mu(A_n)} $

</div>

*Remark:* it is clear that the outer measure of a rectangle must coincide with the measure constructed above. 

<div class="proposition" markdown="1">

**Properties of the Outer Measure**

1. $\mu^{\star}$ is correctly defined (finite) for any $A \subset E$
2. $\mu^{\star}$ is $\sigma$-semi-additive, i.e.
    - If $A \subset \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n, \; A_n \subset E \;$ then $\mu^{\star}(A) \leq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu^{\star}(A_n)$

<div class="proposition" markdown="1">

**Lemma:**

Let $\lbrace A_n \rbrace_{n=1}^{\infty} \in \mathcal{M}$ then 
- $\forall_{\epsilon>0} \forall_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \quad \exists$ a countable collection of rectangles $\lbrace P_{n_k} \rbrace_{k=1}^{\infty} \in \mathcal{M}$ such that
1. $A_n \subset \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty} P_{n_k}$ 
2. $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \mu(P_{n_k}) \leq \mu^{\star}(A_n) + \frac{\epsilon}{2^n}$ 
</div>

Then by the **lemma**, we have the following inclusions
- $A \subset \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}{A_n} \subset \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}{\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}{P_{n_k}}}$ 

And as the outer-measure of $A$ is an infimum over the set of infinite rectangular covers of $A$ we have the inequality
- $\mu^{\star}(A) \leq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}{\mu(P_{n_k})}}$ 
- $ \leq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{(\mu^{\star}(A_n) + \frac{\epsilon}{2^n})}$ (by the second claim of **lemma**)
- $ = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{\mu^{\star}(A_n)} + \sum_{n=1}^{\frac{\epsilon}{2^n}} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{\mu^{\star}(A_n)} + \epsilon$

Since, this holds $\forall_{\epsilon>0}$ we have our result

**Inner Measure**

Given $A \subset E$ define its inner measure as

*Proof:*

Assume for contradiction that it is not the case, i.e. suppose
- $\mu_{\star}(A)$ $>$  $\mu^{\star}(A)$

Using our definition of inner measure we rewrite this inequality
- $1 - \mu^{\star}(E \setminus A)$ $>$  $\mu^{\star}(A)$

Rearrange terms to find
- $\mu^{\star}(E \setminus A) + \mu^{\star}(A)$ $<$ $\mu^{\star}(E)$

However, we have shown that the outer measure is $\sigma$-additive. Now, as $E = A + (E \setminus A)$ we have $E \subset A + (E \setminus A)$ and so by $\sigma$-additivty of the outer measure
- $\mu^{\star}(E) \leq \mu^{\star}(E \setminus A) + \mu^{\star}(A)$

Contradiction.

<div class="proof" markdown="1">


Take $A \subset E$ elementary, we will prove that $A$ is Lebesgue measurable, i.e. that $\mu^{\star}(A) = \mu_{\star}(A)$, by demonstrating two inequalities
1. $\mu^{\star}(A) \leq \mu(A)$ 
2. $\mu_{\star}(A) \geq \mu(A)$ 

<hr>

$(1.):$ in which we show
- $\mu^{\star}(A) \leq \mu(A)$ 

As $A$ is elementary it may be represented by the finite union of disjoint rectangles
- $A = \bigcup_{i=1}^n P_i$ where $\forall_{i = 1,\ldots,n} \; P_i$ is a rectangle and $P_i \cap P_j = \emptyset$ for $i \neq j$

We have already the elementary measure of $A$
- $\mu(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n{\mu(P_i)}$ 

and the outer measure of $A$
- $\mu^{\star}(A) = \inf_{\lbrace Q_k \rbrace_{k =1} \in \mathcal{M}}^{\infty}{\sum_{k =1}^{\infty} \mu(Q_k)}$ 

In particular, $A \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^n P_i$, such that by $\sigma$-additivity of the outer measure
- $\mu^{\star}(A) \leq \sum_{i=1}^n{\mu^{\star}(P_i)} = \sum_{i=1}^n{\mu(P_i)}$ 

And so, we have our first inequality
- $\mu^{\star}(A) \leq \mu(A)$ 

<hr>

$(2.):$ in which we show
- $\mu^{\star}(A) \geq \mu(A)$ 

Choose a countable rectangular cover $\lbrace P_n \rbrace_{n=1}^{\infty} \in \mathcal{M}$ of $A$, then by the $\sigma$-additivity of the measure on elementary sets
- $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{\mu(P_n)} \geq \mu(A)$ 

Consider the definition of the outer measure, as the infimum over countable rectangular covers of our set $\mu^{\star}(A) = \inf_{\lbrace Q_k \rbrace \in \mathcal{M}} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}{\mu(Q_k)}$ it must be that
- $\mu^{\star}(A) \geq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{\mu(P_n)}$ 

and hence we have our result
- $\mu^{\star}(A) \geq \mu(A)$ 

<hr>

$(3.):$ in which we show
- $\mu_{\star}(A) = \mu(A)$ 

By ($1.$) and ($2.$) we have $\mu^{\star}(A) = \mu(A)$ for any elementary set $A$, in particular, as $E \setminus A$, is elementary 
- $\mu^{\star}(E \setminus A) = \mu(E \setminus A)$  
- $(\rightarrow)$ $1 - \mu^{\star}(E \setminus A) = 1 - \mu(E \setminus A)$ 
- $(\rightarrow)$ $\mu_{\star}(A) = \mu(A)$

*Proof of Lemma A* 

Recall $A \Delta B = (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)$ such that $A \subset B \cup (A \Delta B)$ and now by $\sigma$-additivity of the outer measure
- $\mu^{\star}(A) \leq \mu^{\star}(B) + \mu^{\star}(A \Delta B)$
- Hence, $\mu^{\star}(A) - \mu^{\star}(B) \leq \mu^{\star}(A \Delta B) \tag{\star}$

Likewise we have $B \subset A \cup (A \Delta B)$ and obtain the analagous result
- Hence, $\mu^{\star}(B) - \mu^{\star}(A) \leq \mu^{\star}(A \Delta B) \tag{\star \star}$

**Theorem** ($\sigma$-additivity of the Lebesgue Measure)

Given a countable collection of disjoint measurable sets $\lbrace A_n \rbrace_{n=1}^{\infty}$ 
- $\mu(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}{A_n}) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{\mu(A_n)} $

<div class="proof" markdown="1">


Put $A = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}{A_n}$, as the countable union of measurable sets, $A$ is measurable. In particular as $A \subset \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}{A_n}$ we use $\sigma$-semi-additivity of the outer measure to conclude
- $\mu^{\star}(A) \leq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{\mu^{\star}(A_n)}$ 

As $A$ and $A_n$ are measurable $\forall_{n}$ the outer measure coincides with the Lebesgue measure
- $\mu(A) \leq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{\mu(A_n)}$ 

Conversely, $\forall_{N \in \mathbb{N}}$ we have the inclusion $\bigcup_{n=1}^{N}{A_n} \subset A$ and again by $\sigma$-semi-additivity of the outer measure and the measurability of all sets concerned
- $\sum_{n=1}^{N}{\mu(A_n)} \leq \mu(A)$ 

Finally, as we take the limit as $N \rightarrow \infty$ the inclusion remains true such that
- $\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}{\sum_{n=1}^{N}{\mu(A_n)}} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{\mu(A_n)} \leq \mu(A)$

**Theorem** (Completeness of the Lebesgue Measure)

Let $A \subset E$ be a measurable set such that $\mu(A) = 0$, then for any $B \subset A$ one has

That $\mu(B) = 0$ follows from the claim that $B$ is measurable, non-negativeness of the Lebesgue measure, and semi-$\sigma$-additivity of the Lebesgue measure.

Take the set $C = \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace$, then as an *empty* rectangle, $C$ is, in particular, elementary and measurable.
Consider, the symmetric difference of $B$ and $C$
- $B \Delta C = (B \cup C) \setminus (B \cap C)$

**Definition:** Jordan Measurable Sets

A set $A \subset E$ is called **Jordan measurable** if $\forall \epsilon > 0$ there exist two elementary sets $A_1,A_2 \subset E$ such that
1. $A_1 \subset A \subset A_2$ 
2. $\mu(A_2 \setminus A_1) < \epsilon$

*Statement:* If a set is Jordan measurable, then it is Lebesgue measurable. The converse is not necessarily true.

**Proposition:** Properties of Jordan Measurable Sets

If $A$ and $B$ are Jordan measurable then so are
1. $A \cup B$ 
2. $A \cap B$

(only of union)

Take $\epsilon > 0$ by definition, there exist elementary sets $A_1,A_2,B_1,B_2$ such that $A_1 \subset A \subset A_2$, $B_1 \subset B \subset B_2$ and $\mu(A_2 \setminus A_1) < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$, $\mu(B_2 \setminus B_1) < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$

As $A_1 \subset A$, $B_1 \subset B$ and $A \subset A_2$ and $B \subset B_2$ we have
- $A_1 \cup B_1 \subset A \cup B \subset A_2 \cup B_2$ 

If $A_2,B_2$ are disjoint we have the equality
- $(A_2 \cup B_2) \setminus (A_1 \cup B_1) = (A_2 \setminus A_1) \cup (B_2 \setminus B_1)$ 

In general, we have the inclusion
- $(A_2 \cup B_2) \setminus (A_1 \cup B_1) \subset (A_2 \setminus A_1) \cup (B_2 \setminus B_1)$ 

And hence by semi-$\sigma$-additivity of the lebesgue measure
- $\mu((A_2 \cup B_2) \setminus (A_1 \cup B_1)) \leq \mu((A_2 \setminus A_1) \cup (B_2 \setminus B_1)) < \epsilon$

**Definition:** Outer/Inner Jordan Measure

For $A \subset E$ we define the **outer Jordan measure** of $A$ as the infimum over the Lebesgue measure of elementary sets containing $A$

Similarly we define the **inner Jordan measure**  of $A$ as the supremum over the Lebesgue measure of elementary sets contained in $A$
- $\underline{\mu}(A) = \sup_{S \subset A, S \; \text{elementary}}{\mu(S)}$
