### Degree Theory in $$\mathbb{R}^1$$


Intermediate value theorem: If $$f:[a,b] \rightarrrow \mathbb{R}$$ is continous with $$f(a)f(b) /neq 0$$
then $$\exists c \in (a,b)$$ such that $$f(c) = 0.$$

Take $$\Omega \subset \mathbb{R},$$ a bounded open set. For simplicity, suppose $$\Omega$$ can be 
constructed as the finite, disjoint union of open intervals. Take also $$f: \overline{\Omega} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$
a map without zeros on the boundary of $$\Omega$$, i.e. such that $$\forall t \in \partial \Omega \; f(t) \neq 0.$$
We call the pair $$(f, \Omega)$$ admissible and denote by $$M(\mathbb{R})$$ the collection of all such admissible pairs.

A degree on the set $$M(\mathbb{R})$$ is a map $$\operatorname{deg}: M(\mathbb{R}) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$$ satisfying:
$$(1) \mathbf{Additivity}:$$ If
